        <div>Ruby scripts used to produce the files are available on my <a href="https://github.com/Krazplay/bg3">github page here</a>.</div>

        <div><b>Stats\Generated\Data folder</b></div>
        <div>Armors, weapons, characters, spells data, statuses files <a href='statsdata.html'>can be find through this page now</a>.</div>
        <div>There are a lot of dupe entries currently (I named them _DUPE + random number), likely because the devs have to include the whole file again for a single change in hotfixes/patches.</div>
        <div>Those dupes will be removed in the future, I intend to keep track of what was changed between patches.</div>
        <div>This do not include all items because some of them are produced at the map-level, they are using stats from these lists but they change the name/description. See later below.</div>

        <div><a href="./Levels_Containers.html">Levels Containers</a> - <b>Warning 15MB page</b>, should list everything obtainable in containers (like chests), with the in-game name whenever possible.
        <br>Treasure Tables are shown each time, which takes a lot of space, for a drop rate explanation check <a href="https://docs.larian.game/Treasure_Tables">Larian DoS doc here</a>. Position are X Y Z, but Z is Y in-game, so use X Z.</div>

        <div>What is available below need to be reviewed, the data is likely not up-to-date with current game version</div>

        <div>Items missing in Stats\Generated\Data can be found in levels files. They are created for the level, they can overwrite parameters from the stats and template they're linked to.</div>
        <div>From what I see the stats are always taken directly from another item, nothing added. To know the stats, you have to search the ID (Stats: WPN_Thing_A_0), the template is for apparences.</div>
        <div>aka a weapon may use Weapon+1 template, if they don't overwrite anything it will look identical, but for the stats you have to look at the ITEM stats ID, not the one from the template!</div>
        <div>I have filtered out everything which didn't have stats, then only items which have a localization string overwritten (name, description), sometimes the overwrite is identical to the original.</div>
        <div>There are coordinates for the item but I have not checked if it match the game (using X and Z), I have not searched for what level is what, try to guess it or wait next week :p</div>
