, Orpheus Path Lae'zel

All companions can fill all these roles, so the roles should not be seen as a hard stance in a debate, but the speakers to highlight the risks and options of the big decision. So player questions should remain open ended, asking for party feedback and not telling the party what they will do.



No Compromise: Why they can't be the one to transform, the risks involved, can they trust the Emperor? Some sub nodes should have different reactivity in the case they are already partial illithid, or were open to using the powers but never did



At Any Cost: Why the player needs to be the one to transform, why these decisions may be necessary, the stakes at hand


Bridge: The bridge between the two other topics, to facilitate the and direct the discussion and return the questions back to the player.



Karlach: The only one who can take the players place as the party Mind Flayer. With three companions, she replaces the bridge in most cases. Two companions she replaces the At Any Cost. 

Orpheus Path Lae'zel:Always in the "No Compromise" speaker slot, her only mission is to save Orpheus. If the player decides to allow Orpheus to be assimilated, she will interect with a high possibility of leaving the party and fighting the player if they refuse to change their mind.



This dialog is about the avatar and what they should do, but the decision is not made here as it's possible the player can change their mind when they return to gameplay or talk to the Emperor. This is a discussion of their available options, their feelings towards them, and why the player needs to be the one to transform (exception being Karlach). 

Their is a risk the player may feel sour towards their team for the perceived cowardice, as almost all of them are not willing to transform. This dialog will need to sell why the player is the hero of this story. <br><br><span id='00fda2de-9a88-68f7-af5c-5fd4ae32d937'></span><i>null</i><br>uid: 00fda2de-9a88-68f7-af5c-5fd4ae32d937<br><i>- 0 Check flag(s) (Global):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true - ORI_Laezel_State_IsOnOrpheusPath - Set if Laezel is currently on the Orpheus Path<br></i><i>- 1 Check flag(s) (Tag):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true - Lae'zel -  | Lae'zel, the Gith Companion | (No warrior is more ferocious, no githyanki more loyal to Vlaakith.)<br></i>> <a href='#bf458eb5-7f46-b8a7-8c0b-9a7a1c82c470'>Sacrifice Orpheus, sacrifice the githyanki people to an eternity of Vlaakith's tyranny. </a><br><br><span id='017432f3-9a33-7a92-8823-31cedadf3f8b'></span>0:0 - Let me do this for you.

They attacked the Emperor, causing him to leave the Astral Prism as a foe, and they have no hammer to free Orpheus, as they need his protection against the influence of the Netherbrain. After a short pause to let the players feel the weight of their actions, Raphael appears before them, with a new deal: accept the hammer from Raphael, freeing Orpheus in exchange for giving him the Crown.

She's still stuck in the middle of the Blood War, but she is, at least, alive. She quickly realizes her engine is 'fixed' as long as she stays down here and rapidly goes through the stages of grief to accpeting that she's back where she swore she'd never go - but at least she's in her element. Kicking ass, fucking shit up - and this  time, she has someone she loves with her. Maybe this could work after all... at least for now.

Tone here is optimistic, though ambiguous. Is this a good ending? A bad ending? Something in the middle? No matter what, we want to show Karlach at the height of her coolness. This is not our goofy dork; this is a powerhouse who knows how to survive, no matter what, and may even have fun this time around. Clint Karlach Eastwood mixed with 80s action star.

Three men arrived one day to negotiate the transport of a large amount of weapons and cargo but the talks never got anywhere, but they were not interested in any business dealings and were merely scouting the location for the Elderbrain.



Shortly after the Elderbrain made it's way into cave through the river channels. Everyone present became thralls, picking away at stone to make room for the growing brain, the water slowly turning into brine
and any thrall that outlived their usefulness became hosts to Intellect Devourers.



With some quick thinking and a lot of luck, this smuggler stayed hidden for as long as she could in hopes she could make contact and escape with her sibling, who also worked as a smuggler but was unfortunate enough to be at the other end of the cave when the Elderbrain arrived. Eventually her luck ran out as the number of Intellect Devourers grew and found her location. She fought valiantly, but they proved to be too much as she fell without ever finding her sister.<br><br><span id='010135a6-dd55-4d67-98ab-b9d3cc9070db'></span>0:0 - Where are you from?<br>uid: 010135a6-dd55-4d67-98ab-b9d3cc9070db<br><i>- 0 Check flag(s) (Object):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;false - GLO_SpeakWithDead_State_QuestionsLimitReached - Set on the target of the Speak With Dead if five questions were asked<br></i><i>- 0 Set flag(s) to (Object):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;true - GLO_SpeakWithDead_Event_QuestionAsked - Set on the target of the Speak With Dead for each question the player can ask<br></i>> <a href='#945b971c-6aa9-4547-919d-39fd7f0d0591'>Harbourside...

- have remained committed to Shar and have sacrificed her parents. She is now in charge of Shar's church.
- she could have abandoned Shar at the last moment and saved her parents
- she could have turned from Shar in Act 2, and set out on a mission to save her parents in Act 3, rescuing them
- she could have turned from Shar in Act 2, and set out on a mission to save her parents in Act 3, but instead euthanized them to free them from Shar's curse.
