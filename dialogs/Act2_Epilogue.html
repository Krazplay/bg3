In it, he reacts to the various states that could occur in relation to his desire to rid the Act 2 region of the shadow curse:
- if you've already done everything needed to ensure success. he's grateful and seeks to remain with you on the journey to Baldur's Gate.
- if the curse is not yet sure to be lifted, but there's still something that can be done (ie Thaniel was saved from the Shadowfell, but hasn't been fully restored), he will implore the players to help and offer to join them.
- if it's no longer possible to lift the curse, Halsin is sad and resigned to staying behind to stand sentry over it. He will not be available as a companion in Act 3, and his story effectively ends here.
