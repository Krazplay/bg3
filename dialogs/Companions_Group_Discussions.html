All the more reason to put an end to this, now. I don't know if you're a fool or a lunatic, but you are dangerous. It's time I put you down. So deranged, you can't even see what you've done. You are no more than a monster - and the Blade names you his prey. What madness is this? If you would make light of this butchery... you are a monster. And I will not suffer you to live. You're mad. I'd try to get you help, but there's nowhere to take you, and no time to figure out what the fuck to do. I guess this is goodbye. Don't struggle - it'll only hurt more. Perhaps your derangement is so strong that you do not know what you have done... I should just free you from your misery. How did I not see it before?
