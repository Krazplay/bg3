He's frustrated by the voices of the spirits contained within the book, which are stopping him from accessing the secrets he's sure it contains. If he pushes the spirits too far, they'll respond with force - tearing at him with spectral hands.

When the player approaches, he dispels the image and he feels embarrassed to have been caught doing what he was doing. The conversation turns to his passion for magic however, and he invites the player to try to cast a spell with him together.

For Astarion, this is a game of power - one he's played many times before in the taverns of Baldur's Gate, trying to lure people back to his master. He's an old hand at seduction, very self-assured at first, but the player might not go along with the script he expects them to follow. The next morning, the player wakes to see Astarion standing and getting dressed. They catch a glimpse of scars on his back - a sore point. The scars were carved into him by his old master.
