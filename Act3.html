The second, and it might be a little on the nose, but his cowardly-but-brave behaviour is all a setup for Jaheira to have a sweet little moment where she can have a nice little cathartic nod to Khalid and encourage the kid, because she believes in him. I'll expand on this

Also I've made the rolls intended to be easy since a Harper Pin has very little use and it feels a little weird to restrict players too much from just finding out where it is, but I'm well aware that him being told to look after it then immediately giving it away to a stranger feels weird so there's probably a more sensible way for him to point to it without outright betraying his task!</b><br/>How to trigger: - Go to Jaheira's House and go upstairs
