Summary: The player killed a guard during combat in a particular region (the Grove, Moonrise Towers, and eventually also the Goblin Camp, Haven, Wyrm's Crossing, Baldur's Gate proper). While that combat is ongoing, other allied NPCs in the combat regular play ADs at the start of their turn to warn the player that they will inform the other guards about this fact if they survive the combat (if they do survice, they will run out of sight and afterwards every other allied guard in the region will attack the player on sight).
