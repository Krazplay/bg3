There are two variants. One where the curse has been lifted, one where the curse hasn't been lifted.

If the curse has been lifted, Halsin and/or Art Cullagh will be present at Moonrise if alive, and will tell players that the quest has succeeded, and that when they leave Moonrise, they'll see the restults. They tell you to wrap up your business here first. This happens in the dialogues for those characters, not here.

When the altar appears the door that leads outside gets locked. You need to recite the dogmas at the altar and spill your blood on it to open the door.
If you a follower of shar you can do it with not issue and get a blessing.
If you aren't a follower of shar, but you passed all the saving throws you can also get a blessing of shar by reciting the dogmas.
If you didn't pass all the saving throws and perform a ritual then the guardians appear because you aren't worthy.
If you desecrate the altar by taking the dagger then the guardians appear no matter who you are.<br><br><span id='06f8f1e6-cb93-8198-4a88-9bea748cdf53'></span>0:0 - <i>Leave.</i><br>uid: 06f8f1e6-cb93-8198-4a88-9bea748cdf53<br>=== END NODE ===<br><br><span id='0bd02dd8-82fa-55f0-e62a-66f9383c3adc'></span><i>null</i><br>uid: 0bd02dd8-82fa-55f0-e62a-66f9383c3adc<br><br><span id='27b288a7-59e4-e5cd-a349-7954750904e2'></span>0:0 - <i>The dagger won't be missed - take it.</i><br>uid: 27b288a7-59e4-e5cd-a349-7954750904e2<br><i>- 0 Check flag(s) (Global):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;false - TWN_CentralSquare_State_AltarDesecrated - <br></i>> <a href='#f01f04c4-6f05-8e4e-f7b6-a5200062f0bd'><i>null</i></a><br><br><span id='3ab2fa52-5255-26e3-477e-1dc2848b02dd'></span>0:0 - <i>Take up the dagger, recite Shar's wisdom and offer blood from your arm.</i><br>uid: 3ab2fa52-5255-26e3-477e-1dc2848b02dd<br><i>- 0:0 Tag:  Cleric of Shar -  Player or NPC is cleric of Shar.
