She kills not just for fun, but she sees murder as an artform.

If Orin has impersonated 2 person in Wyrm's Crossing (possible targets The Smith, The Journalist, The DyingAttacker, or The Flaming Fist), their bodies will end up in Bhaal Temple.

2 Bhaalist NPCs will comment and facinate over the way she has killed the victims.

In the edge-case where Orin might not have impersonated anyone in Wyrm's Crossing, a random citizen's body will be used on display instead.<br><br><span id='09d74802-31e3-e792-0b00-fd3b93ea6e41'></span>0:0 - Not if the poison made the skin leak blood and the eyes weep pus.

1) Players unlocked the abductee stealthily before the dialog with Orin. Which would trigger a dialog with Orin. After that dialog with Orin, the abductee will wake up and play this AD. Combat than begins. Yenna would run away, companions will join players as a follower.

2) Players have entered combat with Orin, and during combat, they unlock the abductee. In which case they will awaken immediately and play this AD. Yenna runs away, companion joins as follower.

3) Player have defeated Orin and unlock the altar, in which case they are all in relatively safe enviroment. Yenna would not need to run away, companion would not need to join as follower.

During combat, players attempt to rescue the victim. When the players unlock the altar, the victim is awakened and plays this AD as they are awakened.

If the victim is a player companion, they join combat as an AI NPC.
If the victim is Yenna she runs away.<br><br><span id='27cf9c6c-f89c-41b8-8f17-05ecc5068547'></span>0:0 - Did Orin do this? I will make her <i>suffer</i>.<br>1:0 - Where are we? Ah, we're in trouble.

('Normally', because there is an edgecase in DU path that Orin can't turn into a Slayer if the DU already has the slayer form).

But players can immediately attack Orin before her dialog and therefore miss the whole turn into slayer transformation.

This AD is for 2 circumstances :-
1) Players attack Orin before she spots them, therefore never entering dialog with her and therefore combat must begin immediately. Combat begins, she needs to wait for her turn to play this AD, at the end of which she will then turn into the slayer in gameplay.
2) In dialog with her, players click the Attack button, and therefore ending the dialogue abruptly and starts the combat - which is then similar to scenario 1.<br><br><span id='4d3c2ec9-b0b7-ad21-43cc-c769623a7933'></span>0:0 - At last, slaughter kin.

She has given them an ultimatum to kill Gortash and retrieve his Netherstone for her, or the player's abducted companion will be sacrified.  If the players didn't have a valid companion for kidnapping, Yenna will take the place of sacrifice.

Depending on the approach the player took to the altar, they may be in a slightly different position relative to the altar. Orin will teleport into the same spot on the alter in order to begin the dialogue.

Regardless of the player's actions within the temple, and regardless of Gortash's fate, Orin will eventually begin a fight with the players. Determined to prove to Bhaal and herself that she is a worthy Chosen of Bhaal.

She kills not just for fun, but she sees murder as an artform.

If Orin has impersonated 2 person in Wyrm's Crossing (possible targets The Smith, The Journalist, The DyingAttacker, or The Flaming Fist), their bodies will end up in Bhaal Temple.

2 Bhaalist NPCs will comment and facinate over the way she has killed the victims.

In the edge-case where Orin might not have impersonated anyone in Wyrm's Crossing, a random citizen's body will be used on display instead.<br><br><span id='162249c3-65b4-a80b-9e7b-3916fb2038f7'></span>0:0 - You show me this corpse, I see meat.
