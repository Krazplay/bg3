In this scene, Shadowheart is feeling vulnerable after having been abandoned by her goddess, and seeks a moment of catharsis with the player - she had previously shared with them that she didn't know how to swim, and now wishes to reclaim a bit of herself after her identity as a shar follower is lost.
She and the player bond and a playful, tender romance scene ensues after the return to shore.
