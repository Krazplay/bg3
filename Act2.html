The whispers are cued at specific triggers around the Colony, and will play only once. This AD can play anywhere in the Colony, except the Ketheric Showdown chamber and the hallway approaching it.

Consider these ADs like a psychic intercom, the Elder Brain communicating with minions inside the Colony (thralls, illithids and Myrkulites alike). Most of the time, it will use its "Voice of the Absolute" to issue commands or rile up the troops, but sometimes the illithid side of the Elder Brain will slip through the cracks and address you, the player, directly, asking you to come and save it from the dominion of the Chosen Three.

This AD is repeated on a timer, and will select the next available branch in sequence. The Logical Names of the greeting nodes refer to the areas in which these flags can be triggered, those areas being UPPER (upper floor)/LOWER (lower floor)/NEARBY (near the Ketheric Showdown chamber). ANY nodes can always be selected in any area.
To only see a certain branch in the appropriate area, use the InArea flags, but make sure to add an additional greeting node without InArea flags that jumps to the next greeting node in the sequence, to prevent the AD sequence from getting stuck. Note that NEARBY and LOWER can overlap, so if you want something for lower only, make sure that InArea_Nearby is unchecked.

The sequential selection of nodes is done using local flags and binary combinations of those flags.
Any controlled player will be randomly selected for this AD, if they are available for dialog.

These ADs play in random locations around the player upon whom the AD is played (use the COL_ElderBrainADs_Event_TeleportSpeaker flag on the upcoming speaker in a logic node for this, except for the greeting node).</b><br/>How to trigger: - Load up GustavDev/SCL_Main_A
- Stand within the ElderBrainADs_Area triggers. The ADs will play after a timer ends, provided the timer is not interrupted by dialogs/PADs or combat.
- You need to be inside the Colony for these to trigger, and not within the Oubliette or Ketheric Showdown chamber. A good location to be is "goto 757 -35 -82", at the border of the LOWER and NEARBY area.
- Make sure not enter combat, an interactive dialog or a PAD.
- The timer should be between about 40 to 60 seconds.
