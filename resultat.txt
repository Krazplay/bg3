   - Shadowheart decided to share an old memory with us - one of a few spared from her amnesia. We saw her as a lost child, being pursued by a wolf through a dark forest. Some Shar worshippers, led by the masked Mother Superior, came to her rescue and took her into their care. Though Shadowheart reflected on the memory with gratitude towards her saviours, we couldn't help but point out that it seemed manipulative to ensnare a child in such a way.
       WolfDreamSharedAbuse
       objective: Continue travelling with Shadowheart.
   - We pointed out to Shadowheart that her memory of wandering a dark forest bore some resemblance to traditional Selûnite coming-of-age rites, where young children would have to navigate their way home with the aid of Selûne's moon glow. Shadowheart was troubled by the comparison.

       objective: Continue travelling with Shadowheart.

       StartJusticiarQuest
       objective: Continue travelling with Shadowheart.

       NobleStalk
       objective: Continue travelling with Shadowheart.
   - We discovered that Shadowheart possesses a certain amount of resistance to the ill effects of the shadow curse. It seems that this must be due to Shar's patronage - but given the mercurial nature of the dark goddess, the extent of her protection remains to be seen.

       objective: Continue travelling with Shadowheart.

   - We discovered the Gauntlet of Shar - a huge, ancient temple dedicated to the dark goddess. Shadowheart will surely want to investigate further.
       SharTemple
       objective: Investigate the Gauntlet of Shar.
   - Shadowheart has slain the Nightsong, and has risen as the last Dark Justiciar conferred by the Gauntlet of Shar. Her goddess commanded her to carry out a purge of disloyal elements amongst her worshippers, starting with the traitor, Ketheric Thorm. 
       KilledNightsong
       objective: Defeat Ketheric Thorm.
   - Shadowheart spared the Nightsong, in spite of Shar's demands that she be sacrificed. Shar will no doubt be furious, but the Nightsong seems to know something about Shadowheart's past. Whatever secrets she can reveal may be worth risking the wrath of a goddess.
       SparedNightsong
       objective: Leave the Shadowfell.
   - Shar has punished Shadowheart by stripping her of all favours and exiling her from her church. Now all Sharrans will view Shadowheart as a pariah and an enemy. All she can do now is seek out the counsel of Nightsong - or Dame Aylin, as she is known - and see what answers she can provide.
       EnemyOfShar_SharWrath
       objective: Learn about Shadowheart's past from Dame Aylin.
   - Dame Aylin revealed the truth to Shadowheart. She was not saved by Sharrans as a child, but abducted and indoctrinated by them. Furthermore, her parents still live in Sharran captivity, and are bound to their daughter by a curse - the source of the pain that emanates from Shadowheart's wound. Shadowheart must make for Baldur's Gate in order to rescue her parents and free herself from Shar's influence.
       EnemyOfShar_NightsongMeeting
       objective: Journey to Baldur's Gate.
   - We have defeated Ketheric Thorm, just as Shadowheart was commanded to do by her goddess. Now she must continue to purge the Church of Shar of those deemed to be disloyal or failures. Shadowheart's old cloister in Baldur's Gate is to be her next target. 
       SharPath_DefeatedKetheric
       objective: Journey to Baldur's Gate.
   - We have arrived in Wyrm's Crossing. Shadowheart believes that Sharran lookouts will be present in the vicinity, awaiting her return. She must find one such lookout in order to learn where the Sharran cloister is hidden. She expects to find such a lookout hiding amongst the desperate new arrivals flooding into Wyrm's Crossing.

       objective: Continue travelling with Astarion.

       AstarionToldRaphael
       objective: Seek out the devil Raphael.
   - We met Raphael at the Last Light Inn and Astarion asked about the scars Cazador left on his back. Raphael seemed interested - he said he'd think about Astarion's request and see us again soon.
       MetRaphaelHaven
       objective: Find Raphael in the shadow-cursed lands.
   - We met Raphael at Last Light Inn, but he left before Astarion could ask about the scars on his back. Raphael seemed to think we'd meet again soon, though, so perhaps Astarion will have another opportunity.
       MetRaphaelHaven_NoInfo
       objective: Find Raphael in the shadow-cursed lands.
   - We met Raphael at the entrance to the Thorm Mausoleum. The devil told us about an orthon - a monster from the Hells - that's lurking beneath the mausoleum. He promised to tell Astarion about his scars, but only if we kill this orthon for him.
       MetRaphaelMasoleum
       objective: Kill the orthon.
   - We killed the orthon, as Raphael asked. Now we're waiting for him to reappear and fulfil his promise to Astarion - whenever and wherever that might happen.
       KilledOrhon
       objective: Await Raphael's next appearance.
   - Raphael told us about the 'Rite of Profane Ascension'. Cazador plans to perform it, sacrificing his vampire spawn in exchange for great power. Astarion is the only missing piece of the ritual and Cazador needs him back. Astarion told us he wants to take the fight to Cazador in Baldur's Gate.
       ScarsRevealed
       objective: Travel the road to Baldur's Gate.
   - Raphael left without revealing anything about Astarion's scars. It seems if we want answers, we'll need to reach Baldur's Gate and ask Cazador himself.
       RaphaelLeftNoInfo
       objective: Travel the road to Baldur's Gate.
   - We've reached Baldur's Gate. Astarion will want to find Cazador Szarr and face him, deciding his fate once and for all.

   - Astarion met Ulma, the leader of a small tribe of monster hunters. She recognised Astarion as the one who stole their children for Cazador, but offered him a chance to redeem himself if he helped their children. Astarion refused and we were attacked by Ulma's people.

   - Astarion met two of his fellow vampire spawn, Dalyria and Petras, at Fraygo's Flophouse. We learned Cazador plans to perform a ritual that will grant him incredible power, and that Astarion is part of it.

       MetFlophouseSpawns_Ritual
       objective: Reach Cazador's palace.
   - Astarion met two of his fellow vampire spawn, Dalyria and Petras, at Fraygo's Flophouse. We learned Cazador plans to perform a ritual and gain incredible power, and that Astarion is a key part of that ritual. The spawn turned to mist and disappeared after a confrontation with Astarion. We will need to find Cazador to learn anything else.
       MetFlophouseSpawns
       objective: Reach Cazador's palace.
   - A group of vampire spawn attacked us during the night. They tried to kidnap Astarion and take him back to Cazador, but failed. Astarion will need to face Cazador if he's ever to be safe from his past.

       EnteredDungeon
       objective: Locate and investigate Cazador's lair.
   - Astarion met Sebastian, one of the first victims he ever brought Cazador. Instead of feeding on him, Cazador turned Sebastian into a vampire spawn and locked him in this dungeon. We don't know how many of Astarion's victims are still 'alive' down here, but we did learn that Cazador's staff controls the prison. We'll need to take it from him if we're to decide the prisoners' fates.
       MetSebastian
       objective: Locate and investigate Cazador's lair.
   - We found a scroll describing the ritual Cazador wants to perform. He plans to sacrifice thousands of souls, including Astarion's, to ascend and gain incredible power.

       LearnedStaff
       objective: Locate and investigate Cazador's lair.
   - We found Cazador and convinced him to let us go and bring Astarion to him. Astarion will definitely want to hear about this.
       FoundCazador_Fetching
       objective: Face Cazador Szarr.
   - We found Cazador, who overpowered Astarion and dragged him into the ritual. Now that Cazador has everything he needs, he'll ascend unless we stop him.

       RitualCapture

       CazadorInCoffin
       objective: Face Cazador Szarr.
   - Astarion has become the Vampire Ascendant. He had to sacrifice Cazador, his brothers and sisters, and thousands of other vampire spawn; but he'll never fear the sun or suffer a vampire's hunger again.
       Ascended
       Quest completed

       ReleasedPrisoners
       Quest completed

       Quest completed

       LeftPrisoners
       Quest completed
   - Astarion never faced Cazador, but events are moving too quickly to change that now. It's time to choose your destiny - Astarion's will have to wait.
       LeftToEND
       Quest completed
   - We killed Ulma. Without her, the monster hunters will be much less of a threat to Astarion.
       Ulma_Dead
       objective: Reach Cazador's palace.
   - We brought Astarion to Cazador, who used blood magic to force Astarion into the ritual. We need to help Astarion and destroy his old master.

   - We met Raphael at Last Light Inn, but he left before Astarion could ask him anything. Raphael seemed to think we'd meet again soon, though, so perhaps Astarion will have another opportunity.
       MetRaphaelHaven_NoInfo_NoScars
       objective: Find Raphael in the shadow-cursed lands.
   - Raphael left without Astarion speaking to him. Whatever Astarion's questions were, he'll have to look for answers somewhere else - maybe in Baldur's Gate itself.
       RaphaelLeftNoInfo_NoScars
       objective: Travel the road to Baldur's Gate.
   - Astarion thinks we need to find some of his fellow spawn if we want to learn about Cazador's plans. Apparently, they used to hunt for victims in the dens of the city.
       ToldOtherSpawns_INT
       objective: Travel the road to Baldur's Gate.
   - We can now look for the other spawn that Astarion mentioned before. We should look for them in the taverns and flophouses of Wyrm's Crossing.

       objective: Reach Cazador's palace.

       ToldOtherSpawns_WYR

   - Instead of killing the orthon, we helped him, which means Raphael won't reveal anything about Astarion's scars. If he wants answers, Astarion will have to look elsewhere. Maybe in Baldur's Gate itself.

       FoundJusiticiar_KnowShar
       objective: Explore Grymforge.

       FoughtFiends
       objective: Explore Grymforge.
   - We learned that Grymforge leads to an ancient temple. Perhaps the truth of what happened to the Dark Justiciars can be discovered there.
       HeardSharTemple (dev comment: Went through dialog UND_DuergarLoyalSergeant, through nodes N1747 OR UND_TheDrowNere_FollowUp.lsj on node N313 OR UND_TheDrowNere_Dead.lsj on node N3)
       objective: Reach the ancient temple.
   - The bridge to the ancient temple has been destroyed - there must be another way in.
       HeardSharTemplePathBlocked (dev comment: Went through dialog UND_TheDrowNere_FollowUp.lsj on node N42. Or otherwise walked a new trigger by -662;280 (overlooking Shar Temple on the broken bridge). Already had HeardSharTemple)
       objective: Reach the ancient temple.
   - The cultists were trying to find an ancient temple, but the bridge has been destroyed. If we find another way in, we might discover what happened to the Dark Justiciars.
       WalkedSharTemplePathBlocked (dev comment: Went in new trigger by -662;280 (overlooking Shar Temple on the broken bridge). Did not received HeardSharTemple [This is a fallback in case things went nut and no one is going to tell you about Shar Temple.])
       objective: Reach the ancient temple.
   - We found murals in the grove that seemed to depict an ancient order of Sharran warriors - the Dark Justiciars. Further signs of their presence - historical or otherwise - may lie elsewhere.
       JusticiarHint_Murals_Update
       objective: Find the Dark Justiciar's lair.
   - We found a finely sculpted idol of the goddess Shar, and decided to gift it to Shadowheart. She was greatly pleased; the discovery of such a piece bolstered her hopes of uncovering further signs of a Dark Justiciar presence.
       JusticiarHint_SharIdol_Update
       objective: Find the Dark Justiciar's lair.
   - The Archdruid Halsin described how there was once an entire army of Dark Justiciars that waged war against followers of Selûne, long ago. The rites of becoming a Dark Justiciar are no mean feat - they must have had a substantial lair in order to train and anoint a force of such size.
       JusticiarHint_Halsin_Update
       objective: Find the Dark Justiciar's lair.
   - We found an ancient temple of Selûne that had seemingly been razed by Dark Justiciars in the past. Such a force must have had a stronghold to operate from. Perhaps it can still be found.
       JusticiarHint_Selune_Update
       objective: Find the Dark Justiciar's lair.
   - It seems that there are limits to Shadowheart's resistance to the shadow curse - she is as vulnerable as anyone wherever the shadows are strongest. Perhaps her goddess tests her.
       DeepShadowCurse
       objective: Reach the ancient temple.
   - A great many Dark Justiciars seem to have perished while fighting near the graveyard. We must be drawing close to the place Shadowheart wishes to find.
       JusticiarHint_TempleApproach_Update
       objective: Reach the ancient temple.
   - We discovered that Shadowheart possesses a certain amount of resistance to the ill effects of the shadow curse. It seems that this must be due to Shar's patronage - but given the mercurial nature of the dark goddess, the extent of her protection remains to be seen.
       JusticiarHint_ShadowCurse_Update
       objective: Reach the ancient temple.
   - We discovered the remains of long-dead Dark Justiciars in the ruined town of Reithwin. It seems they fought to the death in an effort to defend something important to them.

   - We reached the place that Shadowheart had been seeking - an ancient temple dedicated to Shar. We should investigate further.
       FoundSharTemple
       objective: Explore the Gauntlet of Shar.
   - Shadowheart realised that this temple is the legendary Gauntlet of Shar - a proving ground where initiates would seek to become Dark Justiciars. After investigating an altar, she learned that a series of trials must be overcome in order to be anointed a warrior of Shar. Shadowheart wishes to complete the trials and become a Dark Justiciar herself.
       FoundTrials
       objective: Complete the trials of Shar.
   - We have found the Spear of Night. Now we only need to clear the way to the Inner Sanctum of the Gauntlet of Shar, where Shadowheart seeks to be anointed as a Dark Justiciar.
       LootedSpearOfNight_Communion
       objective: Proceed with the trials of Shar.
   - Shadowheart revealed to us that in order to become a Dark Justiciar, she must first acquire a weapon called the Spear of Night, hidden somewhere in the Silent Library.
       HadCommunion_NoSpear
       objective: Find the Spear of Night.
   - We have cleared the way to the Inner Sanctum. Shadowheart is now very close to proving herself to Shar and becoming a Dark Justiciar. We should accompany her downwards.
       EnteredSanctum_Alt
       objective: Venture into the Inner Sanctum.
   - We have surmounted all the trials and cleared the way to the Inner Sanctum. Shadowheart is now very close to proving herself to Shar and becoming a Dark Justiciar. We should accompany her downwards.
       CompletedTrials
       objective: Venture into the Inner Sanctum.
   - After praying to Shar, Shadowheart told us that she must retrieve a weapon called the Spear of Night from the Silent Library before she goes any farther. Otherwise, she will be unable to become a Dark Justiciar.
       HadWaterCommunion_NoSpear
       objective: Find the Spear of Night.
   - We retrieved the Spear of Night. Now we only need to venture through the Inner Sanctum to where Shadowheart's final test awaits. If she succeeds, she shall be anointed as a Dark Justiciar.
       LootedSpearOfNight_WaterCommunion
       objective: Help Shadowheart finally become a Dark Justiciar.
   - We have entered the Shadowfell - Shar's very own realm. We must descend to where a final test awaits Shadowheart.
       EnteredShadowfell_NoBalthazar
       objective: Help Shadowheart finally become a Dark Justiciar.

   - We have decided to turn on Balthazar. Now we must defeat him so that Shadowheart can deal with Nightsong.
       BalthazarFight
       objective: Defeat Balthazar.
   - We have entered the Shadowfell - Shar's very own realm. We must descend to where a final test awaits Shadowheart. However, Balthazar, necromancer and ally of Ketheric Thorm, is also present, and may pose a threat to Shadowheart's ambitions if we do not intervene.
       EnteredShadowfell_Balthazar
       objective: Defeat Balthazar.
   - We surrendered Nightsong to Balthazar, who took her away to Moonrise Towers. Enraged, Shadowheart turned on us.
       Nightsong_Surrendered
       Quest completed
   - We convinced Shadowheart to turn her back on Shar's wishes, and instead free Nightsong. Rather than become a Dark Justiciar, Shadowheart will instead likely face dire consequences for her actions.
       Nightsong_Spared
       Quest completed
   - We decided Nightsong's fate for ourselves, ignoring Shadowheart's wishes. This is bound to anger her greatly.
       ShadowheartLeftOut
       Quest completed
   - Shadowheart wielded the Spear of Night and killed Nightsong. Greatly pleased, Shar rewarded Shadowheart, and gave her a new mission to pursue.

       objective: Bring the artefact to your Mother Superior in Baldur's Gate.

       objective: Bring the artefact to your Mother Superior in Baldur's Gate.
   - Over the course of my journey, I came by evidence that suggested there was once a Dark Justiciar presence in these parts.

       FoundJusticiarHint
       objective: Bring the artefact to your Mother Superior in Baldur's Gate.

   - I discovered an ancient temple dedicated to Lady Shar. I am her loyal servant - it cannot be a coincidence that I found myself here. Perhaps it is a sign that she wants me to explore this place. A short delay before I return to Baldur's Gate can be no harm, surely...
       SharTemple
       objective: Investigate the ancient temple of Lady Shar.
   - I have proven my loyalty to Lady Shar by slaying Nightsong, the daughter of Selûne. Lady Shar has bid me to purge her followers of those who have failed her - including Ketheric Thorm, but also the Mother Superior. It seems the mission to acquire the artefact was born not of Lady Shar's will, but the Mother Superior's lust for power.

       objective: Punish Ketheric Thorm for betraying Lady Shar.
   - I defied Lady Shar's will and freed Nightsong after she alluded to something from my past. Will Lady Shar forgive me? Does my original mission even matter any longer? I fear I may have ruined everything just for a Selûnite's teasing words...

       objective: Brace yourself for Lady Shar's judgement.

I am an outsider. I have lost everything - apart from whatever secrets Nightsong claims she can reveal to me.

       objective: Learn more of your past from Dame Aylin.

She instructs him to find the 'Heart of the Absolute' and destroy it by detonating the orb.

Mystra asked that Gale seize the crown and then return it to her, in exchange for which she will rid him of the orb. Claim the Crown for himself, though, and the Karsite Weave would answer to him.

Balthazar's Experiment
    ID: ORI_COM_Gale_MagicCircle
    Parent Quest ID: ORI_COM_Gale
    Quest category: Companions
   - We found a strange ritual circle hidden in a secret workshop within Balthazar's chambers. Gale was able to understand the strange sigils used to cast it, and says it was used to create the Moonlanterns that protect their wielders from the shadow curse. Gale says there is enough magic still within it to create one last lantern, one he claims he can make even better than Balthzar's. But this requires him to use a kind of magic forbidden by Mystra. To earn her good favour, he'd be better off destroying it.
       FoundCircle
       objective: Deal with Balthazar's ritual circle.
   - We used a discarded pixie corpse to craft a Shadow Lantern using the strange ritual circle in Balthazar's chambers. Gale believes Mystra would disapprove of such corrupted magic, but she has shown no signs of condemning him further. And the lantern, with its ability to wield the very shadows that threaten us, should prove very useful indeed.
       Crafted
   - We destroyed Balthazar's ritual circle, cleansing the corrupted shadow magic stored within. Though Mystra did not speak to Gale, for a fleeting moment he sensed her presence. She bestowed upon Gale a small token of her approval, a blessing to help him fight against the shadows.
       Destroyed
   - We tried to use the ritual circle without Gale's input, and destroyed it in the process. Gale was not amused.
       AccidentallyDestroyed
   - We left Balthazar's ritual circle alone. Its corrupted shadow magic will slowly fade, tainting everything around it. Unless someone else puts it to use.

The Wizard of Waterdeep
    ID: ORI_Avatar_Gale
    Quest category: PersonalStory
   - I was an archmage - powerful, proud, full of potential - until my failed attempt to impress my lover, the goddess Mystra, left me with a volatile 'orb' of Netherese-corrupted Weave in my chest. Keeping it stable is difficult at the best of times... and these are far from the best of times. I've been abducted by mind flayers, infected with one of their tadpoles. So far the orb appears unaffected, but I can't count on that for long. I need to get back to Faerûnian soil before it begins to hunger.
       Start
       objective: Escape the nautiloid
   - The orb of corrupted Weave within my chest is beginning to hunger. I need to find and consume an item of sufficient magical power to satisfy it, before it destabilises any further. 
       NeedItem1
       objective: Stabilise the orb by consuming magical items.
   - The orb hungers once more. I'll need to consume a potent magical item as soon as I can, or risk its detonation.
       NeedItem2
       objective: Stabilise the orb by consuming magical items.
   - The orb's cravings have returned, more powerful than ever. I need to consume a powerful dose of Weave from a magic item, and soon.
       NeedItem3
       objective: Stabilise the orb by consuming magical items.
   - The item I consumed was enough to satisfy the orb's hunger. However, it will not be long before its cravings return. If I find any more magical items, I'll want to keep them close at hand.
       GotItem1
       objective: Stabilise the orb by consuming magical items.
   - I consumed the magic from a powerful item, but somehow the orb remains... dissatisfied. I suspect it won't be too much longer before it demands more Weave to consume. I'd better make sure I have something ready when the time comes.
       GotItem2
       objective: Stabilise the orb by consuming magical items.
   - It seems my treatment is no longer effective - the last item I consumed was barely enough to quell the orb's tumult. For now, I'll continue my journey, and keep a close eye out for anything that promises a more permanent solution.

       objective: Continue your adventure.
   - My mentor, the great wizard Elminster, sought me out in order to deliver a message from Mystra herself. She instructs me to find the 'Heart of the Absolute', and when I find it, to blow it up by detonating the orb.

   - I died, activating a carefully prepared projection of myself which conveyed with appropriate urgency the importance of my resurrection.
       GaleDied
   - There should be a flute and a letter inside the pouch. They need to play the notes on the letter, starting from the bottom-right and moving clockwise.
       LearnedFlute
   - Playing the flute correctly should summon a magma mephit. It will ask them a question, and they'll need to respond, 'K'ha'ssji'trach'ash'.
       LearnedMephit
   - First, they need to retrieve the special pouch I carry on my person, and unthread the purple seam - moving counter-clockwise.
       LearnedPouch
   - My companion opened the pouch correctly, and was able to retrieve the flute and letter. Now they need to play the correct tune on the flute.

    Quest category: PersonalStory
   - I found a strange ritual circle in Moonrise Towers. It is an evil, corrupted thing that uses shadow magic to force pixies to shine within Balthazar's Moonlanterns. Using one of the dead pixies discarded by Balthazar, I think I could create a much improved version of the Shadow Lantern, but to do so would be to use magic that Mystra strictly forbids her followers from touching. She would want me to destroy it.
       FoundCircle
       objective: Deal with Balthazar's ritual circle.
   - I destroyed Balthazar's ritual circle, cleansing the corrupted shadow magic stored within. Though Mystra did not speak to me, for a moment I sensed her presence. She offered me a small token of her approval, a blessing to help me fight against the shadows.
       Destroyed
   - I used Balthazar's ritual circle to create a Shadow Lantern, capable of not only protecting me from the shadow curse, but wielding the shadows in my defence. Mystra's disappointment is certain, but she shows no sign of punishing my transgression...
       Crafted
   - I left Balthazar's ritual circle alone. Its corrupted shadow magic will slowly fade, tainting everything around it. Unless someone else puts it to use.

       SawUrges

After all, you're going to reap death upon the world sooner or later. Make it sooner!

       objective: Stop resisting the Urge!
   - You like to indulge those Urges of yours. Good. It doesn't matter that you have amnesia. The instincts in your body are kicking in, and you are behaving like your old sinner self again. The Dark Urge is back, back with bloody style.

Call of the Blood
    ID: ORI_Avatar_Astarion
    Quest category: PersonalStory
   - I'm... alive? Well - I'm not on fire - which is something for a vampire spawn standing in the sun. And I'm free! Free from those vile mind flayers and free from Cazador Szarr. But it won't be long before my old master realises I'm missing, so I had better find out what in the hells is going on and quickly.
       Start
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - Even in my dreams, I'm not safe from Cazador. He haunts me - taunts me! But I'm free of him here. And free of his rules: I can feed on whatever, or whoever, I want.
       FirstDream
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - I decided not to feed on any of my travelling companions. They may not have appreciated my attentions, so best not to ruffle any feathers. Anyway, who knows where they've been?
       Bite_Animal
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - As I no longer have to feed on rats, I tried tasting one of my companions. It went a little too well - I lost control and drained them dry. This will complicate matters...
       Bite_Stealth_Murder
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - As I no longer have to feed on rats, I tried tasting one of my companions. It almost went too well - I nearly lost control, but did stop myself before I had a corpse on my hands.
       Bite_Stealth_HalfDrain
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - As I no longer have to feed on rats, I tried tasting a travelling companion. Unfortunately, I bit Gale, who tasted absolutely foul! What else did I expect, biting a living bomb? Not only was I left hungry, but now my secret is out. Everyone knows what I truly am.
       Bite_Gale_KnowsBomb
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - As I no longer have to feed on rats, I tried tasting a travelling companion. Unfortunately, I bit Gale, who tasted absolutely foul! The gods only know what's wrong with him. Not only was I left hungry, but now my secret is out. Everyone knows what I truly am.
       Bite_Gale_NoBomb
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - As I no longer have to feed on rats, I tried tasting a travelling companion. It almost went disastrously - they woke up, but were convinced it was just a bad dream. I got lucky this time, but hiding what I am will only get more difficult the longer we're together...
       Bite_Lie_Success
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - As I no longer have to feed on rats, I tried tasting a travelling companion. It almost went disastrously - they woke up to my fangs at their neck, but were surprisingly understanding once I explained the situation. And now that they know what I am, perhaps they can help if anyone comes after me.
       Bite_Reveal_Success
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - I bit someone in front of my companions, which caused a stir to say the least. So now they know what I am - for better or for worse. Thank the gods I don't have to hide it anymore, though.
       GameplayBiteReveal
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - There was a monster hunter lurking in a hag's swamp who claimed he was sent to capture me and drag me back to Baldur's Gate. Is this some ploy of Cazador's, or do I have other unfinished business in the city?
       MetGurHunter
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - I killed the monster hunter, of course. One less threat to worry about.
       MetGurHunter_Murder
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - My companions came to speak to me - it seems they figured out my little secret. They're more observant than I gave them credit for, but it means I am done hiding my vampirism. From them, at least.
       Act1LeftReveal
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - Cazador returned to haunt my dreams last night. I relived the night he spent carving symbols into my back. I don't know if it's the tadpole's influence or my own imagination, but I swear they were Infernal runes he carved. If anyone can help me translate them, the cambion Raphael can. I need to find him.
       SecondDream
       objective: Seek Raphael.
   - I met Raphael at Last Light Inn and asked him about the scars on my back. He seemed intrigued, but said he'd need time to consider my offer. He implied I'd see him again soon, but when - or where - I can't say. Nothing to do but explore this shadow-blighted land until I find him again.
       MetRaphaelHaven
       objective: Await the secrets of the scars.
   - Raphael made an appearance at Last Light Inn, but disappeared before I could ask him about the scars on my back. There's nothing to do but explore this shadow-blighted land until he pops up again.
       MetRaphaelHaven_NoInfo
       objective: Await the secrets of the scars.
   - I found Raphael at the entrance of a mausoleum. He agreed to tell me about my scars, if I kill the orthon - an infernal beast - living beneath the mausoleum for him.
       MetRaphaelMasoleum
       objective: Do the devil's work.
   - Raphael's orthon is dead, which means it's up to the devil to fulfil his part of the bargain. I just need to wait for him to contact me and tell me all about these scars gracing my back.
       KilledOrhon
       objective: Wait...
   - According to Raphael, Cazador has been preparing a ritual with me and his other vampire spawn at its centre. He means to sacrifice us so he can become the Vampire Ascendant - free to walk in the sun's light and free from the hunger that consumes us. If I'm ever to be free, I have to return to Baldur's Gate and stop him.
       ScarsRevealed
       objective: Take the long road home.
   - Raphael's gone, and with him my chance to learn about the scars on my back. If I want to know the truth, I'll have to find it in Baldur's Gate.
       RaphaelLeftNoInfo
       objective: Take the long road home.
   - Baldur's Gate - home, sweet home! Cazador's palace is in the Lower City. And hopefully the answers I seek are in Cazador's palace.
       ReachedBG
       objective: Find Cazador Szarr.
   - I met Ulma, the leader of a tribe of monster hunters who lost their children to Cazador. (Well, I took their children, but on Cazador's orders.) Ulma said that if I can help their children and kill Cazador, she would call off the hunt for me. I agreed to try.

       Ulma_GurHostile
       objective: Find Cazador Szarr.
   - I found Petras and Dalyria, two of my vampire spawn 'siblings', in Fraygo's Flophouse - an old hunting spot of ours. They told me that Cazador is almost ready to perform a ritual that would grant him incredible power, but he still needs me before he can begin. They said it would take place in a secret defiled chapel beneath the Szarr Palace before turning to mist and disappearing.

       objective: Find Cazador Szarr.
   - I found Petras and Dalyria, two of my vampire spawn 'siblings', in Fraygo's Flophouse - an old hunting spot of ours.

       MetAmbushSpawns_Failed
       objective: Find Cazador Szarr.
   - Some of my brothers and sisters appeared at my camp and succeeded in taking me 'home' to Cazador. Now I'm back in the palace I spent nearly two centuries in. All I have to do is escape, find Cazador, and destroy him forever.
       MetAmbushSpawns_Succeeded_DEPRECATED
       objective: Find Cazador Szarr.
   - An elevator brought me into the depths of the palace, revealing secret dungeons I never knew existed.
       EnteredDungeon
       objective: Find Cazador Szarr.
   - I always thought that Cazador killed every victim I brought him, but no. Sebastian was one of my first, but Cazador turned him into a spawn and left him to starve in these secret dungeons. How many other spawn are trapped down here? Hundreds? Thousands?
       MetSebastian
       objective: Find Cazador Szarr.
   - The 'Rite of Profane Ascension': that's the name a scroll gave to Cazador's ritual. He plans to sacrifice thousands of vampire spawn in exchange for tremendous power - power he does not deserve to have.
       LearnedRitual
       objective: Find Cazador Szarr.
   - It seems the staff Cazador carries can control the prison. With it, I can decide the fates of all the vampire spawn he's locked down here.
       LearnedStaff
       objective: Find Cazador Szarr.
   - This is it - I found my old, wretched master. All I have to do now is end him.
       FoundCazador_NoRitual
       objective: Face Cazador Szarr.
   - I found Cazador, but wasn't able to resist his blood magic. He dragged me into the ritual - now my companions are my only hope to survive this.
       FoundCazador_Ritual
       objective: Face Cazador Szarr.
   - Cazador's been defeated and is trying to recover in his sarcophagus. I can't let that happen - this is my chance to change my fate forever.
       CazadorInCoffin
       objective: Face Cazador Szarr.
   - I am the Vampire Ascendant! I am born anew, with all the power Cazador wanted. All that remains is to dispose of the mind flayer's parasite nesting in my skull and then I will be truly free.
       Ascended
       Quest completed
   - It's over. Cazador is dead, the ritual is ruined, and the spawn have been set free. They will find a place for themselves in the Underdark, while I enjoy the time I still have in the sun. But once I'm free of this mind flayer tadpole, I too will return to the shadows.

   - It's over. Cazador is dead, the ritual is ruined, and the spawn Cazador imprisoned will remain in their cells forevermore.

       Quest completed
   - As I no longer have to feed on rats, I tried tasting a travelling companion. It went... poorly. They awoke to my fangs at their neck and, despite my very reasonable explanation, seem wary of me now. Still, at least I no longer have to hide what I am.
       Bite_Avatar_Failure
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - As I no longer have to feed on rats, I tried tasting a travelling companion. It went... poorly. They awoke to my fangs at their neck and, despite my very reasonable explanation, declared they could no longer trust me. They have left the camp and - honestly? Good riddance.
       Bite_CompanionLeft
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - I decided to tell my travelling companions that I'm a vampire spawn. No one tried to drive a stake through my heart, so I guess they took it as well as can be expected.
       TruthReveal
       objective: Face your hunger.
   - It seems this monster hunter served someone named Ulma. Not a name I recognise, although I hardly stop to introduce myself to monster hunters. Whatever's afoot, this 'Ulma' will have some answers.
       MetGurHunter_LearnedEmployer
       objective: Face your hunger.

   - Instead of killing the orthon, I helped the Infernal thing. I reneged on our deal, so Raphael won't tell me a thing about my scars now. If I want answers, I'll have to go back to the source - Baldur's Gate and Cazador's mansion.

    Quest category: PersonalStory
   - Kressa the Myrkulite necromancer patched you together... you were a tadpoled wreck down in this fleshpit. Nearly dead, head half-caved in. She said you were the first ever tadpoling victim. You're either one-in-a-million unlucky, or someone hated those stinking guts of yours to do such filthy work. Bloody vengeance seems appropriate.
       MistressOfSouls
       objective: Find old friends.
   - You discovered the old illithid pod that might have been your coffin in the Colony. Someone put you there long ago, and must have eventually dragged you out to the nautiloid. The pod was cracked and rank. You were beating every part of your precious body against it, trying to escape.
       Pod
       objective: Find old friends.
   - That man. Ketheric Thorm. He knows you. Past you. Not amnesiac carriage-crash-pile-up you. You must have been a big deal in the past amongst all the scum of this plane. Perhaps there's someone else in this Tower who knows even more?
       Execution
       objective: Find old friends.
   - Enver Gortash revealed more about your former glory. It was you who first put together the plot of the Absolute.

And you can get it all back, by collecting the Netherstones and reclaiming your place in the Temple.
       Ceremony
       objective: Find old friends.
   - Helsik the Diabolist revealed that your distinguished self hired her services in the past. You and Gortash travelled to Mephistopheles' vault to steal the Crown of Karsus. Helsik also gave you the Butler's hat, which it would surely be beneath you to wear.

       objective: Find old friends.

       ORI_Avatar_DarkUrge_OldFriends_End
   - The slimy thing in the Moonrise crack called you its fallen star. It was very reverent. It must have known you when you were still in one piece. See? You are worse than everyone else. Filthy hierophant of the broken and the damned. And apparently good at playing with tentacles. The illithid tide can be dominated by you.
