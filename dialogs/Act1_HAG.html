She confesses that there's something special about it and she can't remove it.

Will play on the player who leaves the dialog that reveals this fact, but characters can be fairly opinionated here since they are reacting to knowledge.

You tell the Hunter where your camp is, the Hunter says he'll take Astarion during the night the next time you go to sleep, then the dialog ends and this PAD plays.
Your companion reacts to your decision to hand Astarion over (speaker 2) and then you clarify/justify your decision (speaker 1)<br><br><span id='367e2346-2a4e-488e-9d14-337e70911d0e'></span>0:0 - I'll breathe easier knowing my neck is safe from his fangs.<br>1:0 - Astarion's as good as dead.

Speaker 1 may have been the character who was in dialog for the scene with Ethel. Speaker 2 is another party member. However, since there may be combat, this setup isn't guaranteed and it's best to write this assuming everyone had a hand in the actions that led to this VB playing.<br><br><span id='ad85a5ae-1194-495f-937b-a23cc94944c2'></span>0:0 - 'Helpless old biddy' - a classic routine.
